# InsightMapper
This is the official implementation of paper **InsightMapper: A closer look at inner-instance information for vectorized High-Definition Mapping** by [Zhenhua Xu](https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/), [Kwan-Yee. K. Wong](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~kykwong/), [Hengshuang Zhao](https://hszhao.github.io/) from the Univerisity of Hong Kong.

## Note
The code will be released in a later stage. Please first check our paper and demos!

## Update
- Sep/28/2023: Update the manuscript. More experiments are added, including the comparison with [MapTR-V2](https://github.com/hustvl/MapTR/tree/maptrv2).

- Aug/24/2023: Release more demos and the supplementary document at our [new project page](https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/InsightMapper/). Code will be released in a later stage. 

- Aug/17/2023: Release paper on arxiv at [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08543).

## Demo
We visualize live demos of InsightMapper under various scenarios, with different whether and time. Some scenes may have complicated road intersection areas. Short demos are visualized with 2Hz, while long demos have 4Hz FPS. 

For more demos, please visit our new [project page](https://tonyxuqaq.github.io/InsightMapper/).
